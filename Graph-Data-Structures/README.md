# Graph Street-Searcher

This is a Java program that implements a simple map application, allowing users to find the shortest path between two points using a custom Graph data structure. The Graph is constructed from scratch, providing an efficient way to navigate through connected streets or locations.

## Features

- Utilizes a custom Graph data structure for efficient pathfinding.
- Tests two points on the map to find the shortest path between them on a smaller dataset of Baltimore, Maryland.

## Note

This was built during my Data Structures class.
